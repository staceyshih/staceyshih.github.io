          <p class="project-detail-text">
            In 2017, when building the backend system, we found that most HR professionals managed recruitment tasks mainly on desktops. Considering development costs and user scenarios, the mobile version was designed just for <b>displaying information</b>.
            <br><br>
            As user habits shifted, more HR professionals wanted mobile management. Fast-growing startups using Yourator also needed faster workflows, but the old backend couldn’t keep up, leading to many manual support requests and low efficiency. 
            <br><br>
            **The team decided to optimize the backend, collecting around 60 survey responses. Improvements focused on core "recruitment management" features, especially "filtering" and "internal messaging," where users struggled most.**

          <h3 class="h3 project-detail-title"> Discovery </h3>
          <p class="project-detail-text">
            Due to the availability of long-term behavior tracking tools (e.g., Hotjar, Google Analytics), a large volume of user complaints and feature requests from the sales team, and time constraints, we ultimately selected the following 2 research methods to help the team identify and prioritize key problems:

                Observed click maps, mouse heatmaps, and reviewed 60+ user session recordings from the past six months related to the application management flow.

              <p class="project-detail-text">
                Interviewed 2 members from each of the following roles to identify common pain points when using the backend system.<ol>
                  <li><b>Headhunters</b> - Who are familiar with Hiring process.</li>
                  <li><b>Business Developers/Account Managers</b> - Who are familiar with Users' common issues.</li>

            <h4 class="highlight-text"> 
              In the heatmap and screen recording observations, many users "click on <b>View Full Resume</b> button immediately" after opening the message.
              <br>
              <br>
              During internal interviews, headhunters also mentioned: "In order to provide a good candidate experience, they always <b>cross-check information</b> before and after communication to avoid errors."

            <h4 class="highlight-text"> 
              In the previous design, the "View Resume" and "Send Message" buttons were separated. Also, the system required HR to "view the resume first" before initiating a conversation with the candidate. 
              <br><br>
              However, during later interviews and feedback, it was discovered that this requirement didn’t fit all use cases and actually increased frustration and confusion.

              HR professionals primarily use company-provided office computers, which results in a greater variety of device types, without a specific pattern. <br><br> Through Google Analytics, it was found that screen widths ranging from 1000px to 2480px were being used. The most common screen widths used were 1920px, 1440px, 1280px, and 420px.

            HRs are experts of Multi-tasking, they must integrate multiple types of information to make comprehensive judgments.
            <br>
            To help HR manage recruitment progress more efficiently, we reorganized the backend page structure, enhanced status indicators to make items that need attention more visible, relaxed system restrictions, and added many shortcuts, making recruitment management more aligned with user needs.
          </p>

                All information related to a specific candidate is now consolidated on a single screen. On the same page level, HR can view resumes, message history, and reply using quick message templates.

                In previous version, the message entry was only represented by an icon, which was not clear enough.

          <p class="project-detail-text">
            Within one month of the launch of this project, HR's average "time to review submissions" <b>decreased by 22%</b>, from 2.4 days to 1.8 days.            <br>
            <br>
            With job posting and submission volumes staying consistent, this reflects a <b>62% boost in response speed</b>, helping candidates receive feedback faster.
            <br>
            Operationally, customer complaints significantly decreased, freeing up the business team to focus on growth.
            <br><br>
            The backend upgrade also supported the launch of new pricing plans, driving <b>additional revenue</b>for the company.</p>

          <h3 class="h3 project-detail-title"> Reflections </h3>
          <h4 class="h4 project-detail-subtitle"> Future Plans </h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Bulk actions. When there's a huge amount of applications flooded in, HRs still need to process it 1 by 1 for now, which is frustrating somehow.</li>
            <li>Viewing history by account. It was hard to tell if this resume was read by which HR, and users need to memorize their own viewing history.</li>
            <li>Include note or labeling features to help HRs async information with cross-function hiring teams.</li>
    
          </ol>
          
          <h4 class="h4 project-detail-subtitle"> Learnings </h4>
          <p class="project-detail-text">
            There are in average 200 Funders and HRs would log in our service. We hope this update would not influence their hiring process. 
            <br><br>
            Therefore, I planned the backend product adoption process, including satisfaction surveys, feature comparisons, updated service manuals, feedback channels, and fallback options.
            <br><br> 
            Thanks to a smooth onboarding experience, no users switched back to the old version after one month, proving the redesign was intuitive and easy to adopt.
            <br><br> 
            Since this project iterated on a design I contributed to as an intern in 2017, which allowed me to reflect on earlier design limitations and deliver a solution that truly met user needs.        </p>
