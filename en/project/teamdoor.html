            Teamdoor combines the concepts of "project management" and "short URL tracking" tools, turning each application submission into a card. HR can manage them using a visual Kanban board, dragging applicants into the corresponding stages.
            <br><br>
            The first phase MVP features include: creating job listings, submitting resumes, managing candidate cards, and the "short URL collector", which integrates resumes from various channels into Teamdoor for unified management, automatically generating "recruitment performance analysis reports".

            To better understand the recruitment work of HR, company recruitment culture, cross-department collaboration, interactions between stakeholders, and real-life application scenarios of the product, we chose to conduct 1-on-1 user interviews. These helped us understand internal recruitment processes in different companies, key concerns, and difficulties encountered, while also conducting usability testing to observe whether users could smoothly complete tasks and understand the product.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle"> User Interview </h3>
            <p class="project-detail-text">
              We interviewed more than 10 recruitment decision-makers and participants, including HR, department heads, COOs, and founders. The companies represented different sizes, including those that had never used or were currently using ATS.

            <div class="highlight-subtitle"> 1. 70% of interviewees need to "save talent" </div>
            <h5 class="highlight-text"> 
              Many users use multiple tools like email, job platforms, or survey systems to collect resumes, which causes information to be scattered. When trying to find a resume that they remember as good, it feels like finding a needle in a haystack. This makes the entire process very difficult, and in some cases, they may even give up.
            </h5>
            <div class="highlight-subtitle"> 2. "Permission levels" are key factors in adopting a tool </div>
            <h5 class="highlight-text"> 
              In many recruitment processes, besides the hiring manager, many team members are involved in interviews, giving opinions, or making recruitment decisions. However, during the recruitment process, there is often confidential information (e.g., salary discussions) that should not be exposed to all participants. Therefore, allowing members to participate in recruitment in a "timely and appropriate" manner is very important to HR.
            </h5>
            <div class="highlight-subtitle"> 3. Prioritize "existing processes" to reduce adoption friction </div>
            <h5 class="highlight-text"> 
              Through interviews, we found that there are many details in the recruitment process that Teamdoor cannot yet satisfy. However, for users, the most important thing is being able to smoothly use this tool to complete their existing recruitment tasks. If it adds too much operational cost or burdens them, they are unlikely to consider using it.

            In real-world recruiting scenarios, many roles are involved â€” including administrative staff, HR specialists, HR managers, and department heads. 
            We decided to focus on serving the <b>actual users operating the applicant tracking system</b>.
            While these users may not always have the decision-making power to purchase recruiting tools, a free trial that clearly saves time and improves efficiency can strongly influence decision-makers to adopt the product.

            Our research revealed that the workflows for setting up, posting jobs, and managing applicants required more flexibility to meet different team needs.
            Based on these insights, we set three key design goals:
          </p>
        
          <div>
            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle">1. Better Candidate Management</h3>

            <p class="project-detail-text">
              Create flexible permission settings so that HR teams can confidently invite colleagues into the recruiting process â€” boosting recruiting efficiency and encouraging product adoption and retention.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle">3. Improving External Communication Efficiency</h3>
            <p class="project-detail-text">
              Every interaction with candidates â€” from emails to job pages â€” shapes the companyâ€™s employer brand. 
              A strong brand image helps attract more top talent.
            </p>
          </div>
        
          <p class="project-detail-text">
            Additionally, we ensured that all new and modified features maintained data integrity, allowing continuous tracking and analysis of recruiting performance.

            In addition to managing individual job openings via a visual Kanban board, Teamdoor provides another perspective â€” a cross-job talent database. 
            This allows HR teams to easily search, reclassify, or batch-process candidates across different job openings.
            <br><br>
            We also introduced <b>Candidate Tags</b>, enabling HRs to quickly categorize candidates with lightweight labels. 
            These tags are displayed directly on the candidate cards, helping HR teams quickly identify key information at a glance.

          <p class="project-detail-text">
            Since many companies design different hiring processes for each role, we introduced the <b>Customizable Recruiting Stages</b> feature.
            Users can now flexibly set one or multiple stages under each job opening without affecting final performance statistics, even when the hiring process changes.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, leveraging our ownership of a talent marketplace, we designed an <b>Auto-Sync Job Information</b> feature â€” including <b>Job Sync</b> and <b>Quick Apply</b>. 
            HR teams can sync job information between Teamdoor and Yourator, maintaining updates in just one place. 
            Candidates can also quickly apply using their Yourator profiles, streamlining the application process even on mobile devices.

          <p class="project-detail-text">
            Since the product was still in its early stage, we couldnâ€™t afford the cost of building fully customizable permission settings. After team brainstorming, we decided to create a more flexible rule-based system to accommodate different organizational needs. 
            <br><br>
            Interviews revealed that most collaboration needs were tied to specific job openings. Based on this insight, we split permission settings into two main categories:
          </p>
          <b>
            <ol>
              <li>Company Settings</li>

              When inviting new members, you can assign company-level permissions (Admin / Manager / Member) at the same time. 
              During the period of waiting for acceptance  , uses can also pre-assign the member to specific hiring teams for certain job openings.

              <b>1. Daily Summary Email</b><br>
              To make hiring collaboration happen smoothly, it's essential to ensure users are automatically notified of key updates, such as "New Application" or "Interview Invitation." Teamdoor collects all updates within 24 hours and delivers a daily notification email, helping users quickly stay informed and gain a clear overview of the hiring process.
              <br><br>
              <b>2. Notification Center</b><br>

              <b>3. Customized Notification Settings</b><br>
              To reduce users' cognitive load, we designed two types of notification settings: Notification Type Settings and Job Subscription Settings. This gives users the flexibility to choose which updates they want to receive based on their role in the hiring process and their level of involvement.

Even if a candidate isn't selected during the interview, users can schedule a rejection email to be sent a few days later, ensuring the rejection doesnâ€™t feel too abrupt.
              <br><br>
              When a user marks or drags a candidateâ€™s card to the "Disqualified" stage, the system will automatically prompt them to send a rejection email. The email template is pre-filled with relevant content, saving time and ensuring consistent communication.

            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle"> Don't Define Product Target Audience by Company Size </h3>
            <p class="project-detail-text">
              Initially, we focused interviews on companies with 50â€“500 employees. Later, we realized that in SaaS, itâ€™s crucial to first address the problems recognized by decision-makers, while also delivering value to end-users. Only when both parties see the benefits will the product successfully convert into paid adoption.

            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle"> Product Features Evolve with Real Needs </h3>
            <p class="project-detail-text">
              Our early emphasis on marketing analytics tools turned out to be less critical for users, who prioritized hiring and job management functions. We pivoted accordingly, reducing adoption barriers. Deep integration with our job platform Yourator further streamlined job updates and applications, significantly improving user satisfaction.

            <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle"> Iterative Feature Optimization Based on Usage Data </h3>
            <p class="project-detail-text">
              We launched lightweight features first, then optimized based on real usage data. Some seemingly important features, like "interview scheduling," had low adoption due to integration complexity and behavior change costs. Instead of insisting, we focused on meeting the broader intersection of user needs and quickly iterated toward the next high-impact features.
