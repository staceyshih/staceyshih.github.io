              In 3 months, we designed a new short and long form video platform app from 0 to 1 — conducting business validation research and UI/UX design to support market expansion into short-form video content.
              <br>
              <br>
              <em>* Currently in soft launch, the app has reached 100+ downloads, offering 500+ hours of video content and collaborating with 50+ brands and influencers.

            With fragmented viewing habits on the rise, we saw an opportunity: short, interruptible videos were gaining traction while long-form engagement declined. We designed a service that supports video "snacking" behavior while driving traffic back to full-length content.

            Since the app was initiated by business needs, the research focused on increasing user willingness and validating design assumptions.

            Research goals:
            
            <ol> <li>Understand users' perceptions and motivations for using short video apps.
            </li> <li>Identify essential features and prioritize key functions for MVP.</li> <li>Gather insights to inform design decisions.</li> </ol>
            Research plans were developed based on these three objectives.

                  <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
                  <p>Studied multiple short video apps and built an initial prototype.

                Due to time constraints and to maximize the number of interviewees, we chose to conduct remote interviews. In addition to presenting slides, we also provided a clickable prototype link, allowing users to interact while clarifying any confusion. This helped users better understand the concept during the research process, enabling more accurate responses and insights, and improving the effectiveness of concept validation.

              <div class="highlight-subtitle">1. Motivation for watching short videos: “Wasting time meaningfully”</div>
              <h5 class="highlight-text">
                Users tend to be passive in choosing content; too many options cause decision fatigue. 80% of respondents preferred to start watching directly for a more immersive experience, simply skipping what they don’t like.
              </h5>
              <div class="highlight-subtitle">2. Short videos as “indexes” — not substitutes for long-form videos, but part of the filtering process</div>
              <h5 class="highlight-text">
                Users highly value time management, even during video consumption. They often filter for “important segments” using playback speed or skipping irrelevant parts. They prefer to preview with short videos before deciding to watch the full version.
              </h5>
              <div class="highlight-subtitle">3. Content strategy plays a key role</div>
              <h5 class="highlight-text">
                “Exclusive content” is the main download incentive, while “social interaction” is not critical since users already have their go-to platforms. Interestingly, users showed high regard for original copyright: some mentioned downloading TikTok after seeing clips reposted on Instagram to support the original creators or watch full content.
              </h5>
              <div class="highlight-subtitle">4. Features related to “watching videos” should be prioritized</div>
              <h5 class="highlight-text">
                Many video features are expected basics — such as saving, playback speed control, timeline, and preview thumbnails. Poor implementation may erode user trust. Other features like watching without registration or external links are attractive but non-essential. Most users don’t need to create their own videos; they primarily seek high-quality content here.
              </h5>
              <figure class="project-detail-img">
                <img src="/assets/images/fanloop/kano-all-users.png" alt="kano-result" loading="lazy">
              </figure>
              <h5 class="highlight-text">
                Overall, the two user groups showed little difference in feature expectations. Initially, we were concerned that existing CP users might dislike or be unfamiliar with short videos, but preferences across new and experienced users were similar — indicating that prior short video experience does not strongly affect app acceptance.

              <div>
                <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle">1. Instantly enter viewing mode to reduce choice anxiety</h3>
                <p class="project-detail-text">

                <p class="project-detail-text">
                  To enable meaningful exploration, users can control the depth and breadth of content discovery instead of encountering fully random content.
                  <br>
                  Inspired by common swipe gestures, we mapped directions to different content relationships:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Up/Down: Random recommendations based on watch history</li>
                    <li>Left/Right: Switch to related content via hashtags</li>
                  </ul>

                <p class="project-detail-text">
                  Browsing doesn’t end after a video finishes. We offer customizable external links to drive traffic — such as full-length video platforms, official websites, and media articles. Users can also explore creator channel pages or click hashtags for more related content.

                This research influenced not only UI design but also content strategy and business decisions. The main contributions to the product team include:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Helping the team focus MVP development and shorten decision-making time</li>

                <li>Optimizing UI design strategy to better align with user habits</li>
                <p>As noted, we focused on improving video viewing and gesture interactions to ensure the product is intuitive upon launch.</p>
                <li>Using prototyping to boost workflow efficiency, cutting discussion time by 30%</li>
                <p>As the concept was new and unfamiliar, the short video prototypes were reused for presentations, cross-team discussions, and collaboration proposals with editors and external content providers.</p>

              <p class="project-detail-text">
                In unfamiliar domains, we need to empathize not only with target users but also with content creators and internal content teams. Will our design increase maintenance costs? Is it necessary?
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3 project-detail-subtitle"> Product validation still has limitations</h3>
              <p class="project-detail-text">
                Whether existing users would adopt this product remains uncertain. However, research helped identify “recognizable product value” and ways to optimize current design to meet user needs.
              </p>
              <p class="project-detail-text">
                Remote interviews made it difficult to observe user interaction and offer guidance, which affected prototype effectiveness. Pilot tests and timely updates to research materials helped improve accuracy and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                One issue we faced: the feature prioritization in KANO interviews didn’t convince all stakeholders. Later reviews revealed researchers must align feature candidates and phrasing with all “decision-making stakeholders” beforehand to ensure research results influence development order.
